DIALS 2.1.1-gcdd629a7b-release
The following parameters have been modified:

format = mtz sadabs nxs mmcif mosflm xds *xds_ascii json
output {
  log = "dials.export_xds_ascii.log"
}
input {
  experiments = integrated.expt
  reflections = integrated.refl
}

Data appears to be unscaled, setting intensity = profile+sum
Read 11499 predicted reflections
Selected 10276 reflections integrated by profile and summation methods
Combined 138 partial reflections with other partial reflections
Removed 1054 reflections below partiality threshold
Removed 32 intensity.sum.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Removed 11 intensity.prf.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Output 9041 reflections to DIALS.HKL
