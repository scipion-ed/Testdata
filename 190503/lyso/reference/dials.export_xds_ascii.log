DIALS 2.1.1-gcdd629a7b-release
The following parameters have been modified:

format = mtz sadabs nxs mmcif mosflm xds *xds_ascii json
output {
  log = "dials.export_xds_ascii.log"
}
input {
  experiments = integrated.expt
  reflections = integrated.refl
}

Data appears to be unscaled, setting intensity = profile+sum
Read 4447 predicted reflections
Selected 4196 reflections integrated by profile and summation methods
Combined 62 partial reflections with other partial reflections
Removed 466 reflections below partiality threshold
Removed 32 intensity.sum.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Removed 4 intensity.prf.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Output 3632 reflections to DIALS.HKL
