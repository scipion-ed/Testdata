The following parameters have been modified:

format = mtz sadabs nxs *mmcif mosflm xds xds_ascii json
output {
  log = "dials.export_mmcif.log"
}
input {
  experiments = integrated.expt
  reflections = integrated.refl
}

Data appears to be unscaled, setting intensity = profile+sum
Data appears to be unscaled, setting mmcif.hklout = 'integrated.cif'
Read 4300 predicted reflections
Selected 4300 reflections integrated by profile and summation methods
Wrote reflections to integrated.cif
