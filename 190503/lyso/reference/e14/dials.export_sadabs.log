DIALS 2.1.1-gcdd629a7b-release
The following parameters have been modified:

format = mtz *sadabs nxs mmcif mosflm xds xds_ascii json
output {
  log = "dials.export_sadabs.log"
}
input {
  experiments = integrated.expt
  reflections = integrated.refl
}

Data appears to be unscaled, setting intensity = profile+sum
Read 4544 predicted reflections
Selected 4300 reflections integrated by profile and summation methods
Combined 54 partial reflections with other partial reflections
Removed 444 reflections below partiality threshold
Removed 23 intensity.sum.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Removed 1 intensity.prf.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Output 3778 reflections to integrated.sad
