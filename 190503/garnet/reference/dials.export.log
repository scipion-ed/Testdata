DIALS 2.1.1-gcdd629a7b-release
The following parameters have been modified:

format = mtz sadabs nxs mmcif mosflm xds *xds_ascii json
input {
  experiments = integrated.expt
  reflections = integrated.refl
}

Data appears to be unscaled, setting intensity = profile+sum
Read 11972 predicted reflections
Selected 11290 reflections integrated by profile and summation methods
Combined 279 partial reflections with other partial reflections
Removed 431 reflections below partiality threshold
Removed 30 intensity.sum.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Removed 18 intensity.prf.value reflections with I/Sig(I) < -5.0
Output 10532 reflections to DIALS.HKL
